1.1 Proposals:
------------

In this first section we see all the proposals created by users in the "Proposals" section (not to be confused with participatory budget projects that have their own section). All the proposals are listed, with their basic information and a search form. By clicking on the title of each proposal we can see more detailed information about it. Next to each proposal we see the "Select" button. 

The selected proposals will stop collecting supports and will be shown in the "Selected proposals" menu in the "Proposals" section that users see. It is the way to mark that a proposal has received sufficient supports or has been selected for some other reason. CONSUL Administration guide Version 1.0.0 At the bottom of this information page is the Milestones section. This section is used to publish the evolution of the proposals that have been selected. 

A timeline will be published on the public page of the proposal with all the milestones. By clicking on "Create a new milestone", you can add the following information: status (to categorise proposals, for example: "studying the proposal, contracting, building the proposal, finished"; possible states can be defined in the link below), description of the milestone, the date of publication of the milestone, images and documents to show in the milestone. The date and status or a description are the only mandatory fields.

1.2. Collaborative legislation
----------------

In this section are managed the processes of collaborative legislation. The basic process allow three different phases, and in each one can be decided which ones are used. The phases are: debate, proposals and drafting. The debate phase allows to open several questions. The users can give open answers to the questions, and rate other's users answers. The proposals phase allows to the users to write proposals on the issue, and support other users proposals. The drafting phase allows to publish a text. Users can select any part of the text, make comments to it, and rate other comments. 

Clicking "Create new process" can be defined which phases will be active (click in the "enabled" checkbox of each phase), the start and end dates of each phase, the information that will be shown in the web page of the process (title, summary for the list of processes, basic description and additional information), the basic style of the process (header and text colour) and additional documents that can be uploaded when required to that same page as additional information.
