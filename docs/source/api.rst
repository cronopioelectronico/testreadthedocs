1.1. CITY-WIDE PROJECTS: 

These are those that meet some of the following conditions: They are not located in a specific district (for example: to improve some element that exists throughout the city, such as streetlights, litter bins, banks, etc.).

They affect elements that are considered of relevance to the majority of the citizenry (e.g., a project related to the city's main park). 

1.2. DISTRICT PROJECTS: 

They are located in a specific district and do not meet the above conditions. The technical staff of the City Council may change the category of a project during its evaluation by changing its rating from whole city to district and from district to district, when its characteristics point to such a change. This change will be made as soon as the need is detected and confirmed, as soon as possible.
